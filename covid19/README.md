## COVID-19


We have been monitoring the national (& international) maker response to the PPE supply crisis relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and have followed closely the designs that [DoESLiverpool](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/covid19) have been making for their [PPE Manufacturing effort](https://ppe.doesliverpool.com/).

Recently we were passed on a design for a face mask that although well intentioned seemed not fit for purpose.

If we wanted our 3D print club to contribute we recommend we use the designs that DoES Liverpool have been making. The community has already gone through lengthy design conversations and decisions, prototypes, wrong turns, successes and failures, accommodated a range of issues and problems, and now represent a huge body of amateur and professional knowledge. We think 're-inventing the wheel' ie using a new design will not help anyone, as well meaning as this may be.

We could make small numbers of face visors for our own use initially and potentially for staff at NMC combined with appropriate face masks, if ***no other options*** are available. But before this happens, we need to try out the design and see how it works.

## Supporting Others

There are many ways to support each other with or without 3D printing, either practically like a drinking straw holder or something to help hygeine or habits of face touching, or just being creative.

Kay has offered to try out some prints on the Prusa which she now has at home but on a limited basis. I'm looking into getting one at home also.

Kay has a design for something that looks like it supports long term face mask use which we might pursue. Removing a face mask can be tricky, you can effectively spray droplets and contaminate yourself and others with the mask contents if careless.

You can also support the [DoES PPE Project here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/get-visors-into-the-hands-of-healthcare-workers) or mutual aid groups like [Acorn renters union](https://acorntheunion.org.uk/corona/) or [West Cheshire Community Response](https://winsford.gov.uk/3706-2/)


## Getting Started

![3dVerkstan design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoESLiverpool/covid19/041de2d84b67a9eef233c5d71b0d83049e1748ee/3DVerkstan.jpg)

If we do want to try making visors we've reviewed this [comprehensive list and notes](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/covid19/blob/master/FaceShield.md) and think the Verkstan design which DoES and many makers are using would be a good first start, as it could fit an A4 acetate sheet which could be cut by hand using a scalpel, A4 4-hole hole punch and a 3d printed cut template.

>For context the 3d print designs DoES are producing are only in addition to the laser cut design which is far more efficient in terms of manufacturing throughput. 3D printing options are still effective, but just obviously much slower.

We should:

 * Design & prototype
 * Prepare
 * Make

### Design & Prototype

First step is to get a visor prototype. This should only be a prototype, so we won't use it in a situation where we might need it, until we've printed and assembled one and tested it out.

We'll test out wearing them and we can also work out how to pack them and post them safely

#### Designs

 * [DoES version of the 3D Verkstan Face Visor Frame Design](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/covid19/blob/master/visor-designs/3d-printed/3DVerkstan/DoES_Verkstan.stl)

This design is from [3dVerkstan](https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/)

 * [Verkstan Acetate Cut Design Europe A4](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/covid19/blob/master/visor-designs/3d-printed/3DVerkstan/Template-shield-EUROPE-4hole.pdf) which can be done by hand with scissors, a scalpel and a standard 4-hole hole punch with help from this [A4 Cut Template](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/covid19/blob/master/visor-designs/visor-templates/covid19%20Shield%20foil%20-A4%20%20hand%20cutting%20template.STL)

### Prepare
Here's what we need to make the 3DVerkstan frame design with the A4 acetate visor

### Make

Print materials include maker standards like PLA but PTGE is much better for sterilising because it is less porour. PLA can lead to

#### Disinfect & pack

This is an overall guide to [cleaning from Prusa](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/prusa-face-shield-disinfection_125457) with an overview of all the cleaning techniques.

Do not use pure alcohol or 99%, part diluted to 75% is much more affective, allowing the alcohol in solution, to penetrate the cell wall and lipid layer of the virus and kill it that way. Hot soapy water is also very affective, although it makes drying more porous materials more time consuming




## FAQ

![NHS PPE Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1537834/77834073-c0351400-7139-11ea-9014-1614a5902976.png)


 * Will this protect me from Coronavirus?

 Only in a limited way. A face visor on it's own will not protect against airbourne aerosols or droplets that may contain the coronavirus, it must be combined with an appropriate [FFP3/2 Face mask](https://www.3m.co.uk/3M/en_GB/company-uk/3m-products/~/3M-Disposable-Respirators-8300-Series/). These masks are difficult to make in makerspaces or with 3D printers. The visor design will only shield you from aerosols at certain directions and speeds, other particulates circulating in the air, for example in a bathroom with a hand dryer, can of course be inhaled from behind the visor. It does provide protection, but only in a very limited way. Please see the diagram above. It is only one part of the required PPE.
 * Can I use it more than once?

 Ideally they are single use only. However they can be carefully sterilised with hot soapy water or 99% alcohol handwash (not 100% to ensure the alcohol can penetrate the virus lipid surface)
 * Is these official NHS PPE?

 Not the designs we suggest. We must acknowledge that these visors are not 'official' NHS England approved, but a best fit contingency in the context of a supply crisis.
 * Do these designs help the NHS?

 We can probably best help the NHS by staying at home and following the guidelines for the present lockdown. These visors though are something we can experiment with for ourselves if we need to work or shop near others and potentially use post-lockdown in the absence of more appropriate PPE. If we can help the critical demand for PPE by not adding to it, it's helpful but we must understand this is not a simple story of 3D printers saving lives. We are not doing that. People like DoESLiverpool are and have a community working at it, but even then it is not to replace conventionally manufactured PPE visors but to help in an emergency.
 * What are we doing then?

 We are experimenting whether we can support each other in anyway with the skills and resources we have. We must be completely clear on the limited nature of the protection this design may provide. If it only makes us aware of the dangers of contagion, how we behave, who and what we are in contact with, how many times we touch our faces, then that is useful but we should be careful how we present whatever we do.
 * How can I help?

 Best help would be to self isolate as much as you can and take care of the others around you.

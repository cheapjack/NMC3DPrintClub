 * How Do We Talk About This?

It's an exciting story to say you are helping out in the crisis, but it's important to always give as much context for what we are doing as possible and not let important details get left out, especially the conditions that we are making them in, the conditions of use that might make them effective, who might use them (people at NMC and the 3D print club only initially) and the limited impact, if we are honest, we might make to the general supply crisis related to the pandemic. That is a structural problem in society that really should not have to be 'fixed' by amateur makers. 

Be clear that we are not supplying the NHS, but are experimenting with designs from the Maker community to make **Protective Face Visors**. It's important to not call them masks, as this refers to the FFP3/2 rated breathing masks that most effectively filter droplets and particulates that might harbour the virus. It's important not to overstate the protection they may or may not be provided by their use. They must be used with appropriate breathing masks to be fully effective.


 * Will this protect me from Coronavirus?

 Only in a limited way. A face visor on it's own will not protect against airbourne aerosols or droplets that may contain the coronavirus, it must be combined with an appropriate [FFP3/2 Face mask](https://www.3m.co.uk/3M/en_GB/company-uk/3m-products/~/3M-Disposable-Respirators-8300-Series/). These masks are difficult to make in makerspaces or with 3D printers. The visor design will only shield you from aerosols at certain directions and speeds, other particulates circulating in the air, for example in a bathroom with a hand dryer, can of course be inhaled from behind the visor. It does provide protection, but only in a very limited way. Please see the diagram above. It is only one part of the required PPE.
 * Can I use it more than once?

 Ideally they are single use only. However they can be carefully sterilised with hot soapy water or 99% alcohol handwash (not 100% to ensure the alcohol can penetrate the virus lipid surface)
 * Is these official NHS PPE?

 Not the designs we suggest. We must acknowledge that these visors are not 'official' NHS England approved, but a best fit contingency in the context of a supply crisis.
 * Do these designs help the NHS?

 We can probably best help the NHS by staying at home and following the guidelines for the present lockdown. These visors though are something we can experiment with for ourselves if we need to work or shop near others and potentially use post-lockdown in the absence of more appropriate PPE. If we can help the critical demand for PPE by not adding to it, it's helpful but we must understand this is not a simple story of 3D printers saving lives. We are not doing that. People like DoESLiverpool are and have a community working at it, but even then it is not to replace conventionally manufactured PPE visors but to help in an emergency.
 * What are we doing then?

 We are experimenting whether we can support each other in anyway with the skills and resources we have. We must be completely clear on the limited nature of the protection this design may provide. If it only makes us aware of the dangers of contagion, how we behave, who and what we are in contact with, how many times we touch our faces, then that is useful but we should be careful how we present whatever we do.
 * How can I help?

 Best help would be to self isolate as much as you can and take care of the others around you.

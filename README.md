Andy, Chris, Dennis, Jason, Kay, Paul and Ross have been experimenting with the NMC's Prusa i3 Mk3 3D Printer experimenting making [desktop logos](https://github.com/cheapjack/ThoughtsOnTheDesktop/blob/master/models/happySphereLidWithLogo.stl), straw holders for drinks, [phone holders](https://github.com/cheapjack/NMC3DPrintClub/blob/master/models/Dennis_Phone_Holder/iphone11_holder.stl) and wheelchair frame [blanking plates](https://github.com/cheapjack/NMC3DPrintClub/blob/master/models/blankingplate/blanking%20plate.stl).

Insipred by local makers like [DoESLiverpool](https://doesliverpool.com/) we started printing face visors to help people in the NMC community.

## 3D Print Club Futures

We've been working together for over 2 years now designing, thinking, printing, tinkering, measuring and of course printing. Below are some images and links to files to summarise all the amazing stuff we've made and just some of what we've learned together.

### Future Wish list

* 3D Print Shed!

Realistically we need an area for 3D printing so we can control airflow and keep the temperature stable but we also need it to fit with the NMC ways of working  
* Cover for the 3D printer 
* Prusa printer to extend our capacity
* Run an ongoing printer repair shop and prototype different kinds of printers
* Fusion 360 tutorials - teach ourselves Fusion a  more powerful 3D design software - although we get on well with TinkerCAD and OpenSCAD
* Tinkercad Workshops for NMC members run by the club - for beginners designing 3D objects
* Design workshops for augmenting real things - 3D printed wheelchair ramps
* Ender3 printer chassis & parts for prototyping unusual materials, extended bed sizes etc.
* New weird filaments
* Wall rack for Filament 
* 3D Scanner
